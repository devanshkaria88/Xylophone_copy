This app is cloned from the base repository of London App Brewrey's Xylophone App. I have created the full version of it.
Also i have added the build of the application for Android Devices So if anyone wants to run it directly just download the apk file from the repository and run it on  either your physical android device or the virtual android device. 

To run the application and to review the code on android studio:

 Requirements:
 Flutter latest stable sdk
 Android Studio
 Android Virtual Device(to run it on remote emulator)
 Physical Android device(to run it on a physical device)(Make sure to turn on the USB Debugging from the developers options menu.)
 
 To review the code on Android Studio:
 Clone the repository to your device, and then open it on the Android studio as an existing android studio project.
 It will open the default file "main.dart" which is the source code of the app.
